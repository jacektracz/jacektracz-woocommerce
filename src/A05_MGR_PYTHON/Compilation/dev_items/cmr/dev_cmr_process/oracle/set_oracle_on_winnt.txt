restart PC (I tried to restart listeners but it did not work)

connect to orcl sid on port 1521 with hostname YOUR_IP

if you get ORA-12505 at this point, the database might try to register in listener at wrong IP (the contents of the hosts file matter here), if that happens:
1.) sqlplus / as sysdba
     alter system set local_listener = 'YOUR_IP:1521' scope=memory; 
     alter system register;
3.) quit sqlplus and confirm that worked using lsnrctl services- the orcl service should be listed there
4.) if everything is ok- repeat step 1.) but this time use 'scope=both' to make changes persistent
